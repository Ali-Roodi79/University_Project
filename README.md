# NullBox

This project is the university project for my bachelor's thesis.
This project is a digital companion for the **NullBox** board game. This project is a game inspired by the game **Chronicle of Crime**.
Using a collection of physical components that include cards representing locations, characters, and clues, the game lets you enter a world of mystery and investigate and solve criminal cases.

- Below you can see some pictures of playing cards:

## How to use:

- Launch the app, select the scenario you want to play while following your target, uncover the clues behind the crime, follow the evidence, and find the killer as fast as possible.

- Using the game's Scan&Play technology, each card has a unique QR code that can unlock different clues and events if players look carefully enough.
You can see the game map in the image below:
